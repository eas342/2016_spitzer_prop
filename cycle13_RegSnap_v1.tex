\subsection{Science Justification}

\noindent {\bf Disintegrating Bodies - A New Class of Planets}\\
The Kepler Observatory has ushered in a new era of planet discovery and characterization, and dramatically increased the inventory of known planets and planet candidates.
One of the fascinating new classes of planets uncovered by Kepler is that of disintegrating rocky bodies,
which include KIC 12557548b (hereafter shortened to KIC 1255b) \citep{rappaport} and K2-22b \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}.
The KIC 1255 and K2-22 systems are sufficiently bright ($K$=13.3 and $K$=11.9 respectively) for high precision Spitzer IRAC photometry.
They are also both periodic and have well-measured ephemerides that can be followed up with Spitzer.
\textbf{Disintegrating systems offer a rare opportunity to study planets that are being peeled away layer by layer}, and complement studies of polluted white dwarfs, which are sensitive to the bulk compositions of accreted planetesimals \cite[e.g.][]{jura2003wdPollution}.
Thus far, these are the only opportunities we have for accessing different interior layers of exoplanets.
This will be the last chance for infrared characterization until the James Webb Space Telescope begins science operations in 2019.\newline

\noindent {\bf Particle Size and Composition}\\
The K2-22b and KIC 1255b systems show broadband flux decreases that likely come from the optical extinction of dust particles -- gas absorption from atomic or ionized gas would not have enough opacity to create the large broadband transits observed by Kepler photometry \citep[0.42 $\mu$m to 0.90 $\mu$m bandpass;][]{koch2010keplerChar}.
The creation and/or destruction of dust particles cause variable transit depths, shown in Figure \ref{fig:exKeplerCurves}.
The transit depths can vary from $\sim$0\% (undetected) to 1.3\% depending on the level of disintegration activity.
The disintegration is correlated with magnetic activity on the surface of the K5 star in the KIC 1255 system \citep{kawahara2013starspots}, but this effect can also occur from the occultations of starspots by planetary debris \citep{croll2015starspots}.

The slope of the transmission spectra of the dust from the disintegrating bodies is sensitive to particle size, with a steep spectral slope indicating small particle sizes and a shallow spectral slope indicating large particle sizes.
There are some indications that the spectral slope (and thus particle size) changes over time.
\citet{bochinski2015evolving} find that the slope of the transit depth as a function of wavelength for KIC 1255b changes between two nights and that the slope was flatter during a shallow transit than a deeper transit. 
\cite{sanchis-ojedak2-22} also find that K2-22b shows a steeper spectral slope during a deeper ($\sim 0.8\%$) event whereas a flat spectrum during a shallower ($\sim$ 0.4\% event).
In both cases, particle sizes of $\gtrsim$0.5$\mu$m are inferred.
Still, the particle sizes above $\sim$0.5$\mu$m as well as their composition remain unknown.

We aim to use Spitzer photometry to characterize the particle sizes of the debris to higher precision than has been achieved with ground-based optical and near-infrared data.
So far, there is only a lower limit on the particle sizes measured during medium and shallow transits.
A lower limit of $\sim$0.5$\mu$m was placed on the dust particle sizes for medium depth transits of KIC 1255b using simultaneous $K$ band (2.4$\mu$m) and Kepler broadband (0.42 to 0.90$\mu$m) photometry \citep{croll2014}.
Similarly, \citet{schlawin2016kic1255} find a lower limit of 0.5$\mu$m sized grains for olivine and pyroxene compositions using low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy (0.9 to 2.4$\mu$m) and optical photometry.
\textbf{Spitzer IRAC photometry is needed to study the large ($0.5\mu$m) dust particles escaping from KIC 1255b and K2-22b.}
No other observatory is capable of obtaining high precision light curves at wavelengths longer than 3$\mu$m, where the $\sim$1$\mu$m  particles transition from high extinction cross sections to low extinction cross section (relative to optical) and thus reveal their sizes.
These large particles constrain the disintegration mechanisms of disintegrating planets, such as explosive volcanism versus condensation from a metal-rich vapor \citep{rappaport}.\newline

%\noindent {\bf Underlying Planet}\\
%
%Little is known about the underlying planets from which the disintegration occurs.
%For KIC 1255b, there are upper limits on the mass of 1.2 R$_{Jup}$ from radial velocity observations \citep{croll2014} and a radius of ~4600 km for an albedo of 1 \citep{vanWerkhoven2014} from the lack of secondary eclipse.
%Similarly, for K2-22b, the upper limit on the mass is 1.2 R$_{Jup}$ \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22} from radial velocity data but this does not constrain the properties of the planet other than ruling out stellar-mass objects as causing the transit-like features.
%In the event of weak disintegration activity and small particle sizes, Spitzer photometry can put new constraints on the size of the planet \newline

\noindent {\bf Tail Geometries}\\
The K2-22 and KIC 1255 systems are interesting to compare and contrast because they display many of the same stochastic transit depth behaviors, but have different transit profiles.
KIC 1255b and K2-22b have orbital periods of 9.1 and 15.7 hours, respectively, but have about the same 2100 K equilibrium temperature because of K2-22b's  500 K cooler host star \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}.
The transit profile for KIC 1255b is highly asymmetric, suggesting a comet-like tail trailing the planet whereas K2-22b is more symmetric, shown in Figure \ref{fig:TransitProfiles}.
For K2-22b, the material appears to exhibit Roche-lobe overflow onto the host star \cite{sanchis-ojedak2-22}.
We will explore the effect of particle sizes on these two different geometries for the two systems.
\newline

\noindent {\bf Transit Variability}\\
One of the great challenges of disintegrating planet systems is that the transit depths are wildly stochastic and unpredictable, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:exKeplerCurves}.
Our observing program requires that at least 3 transits be observed for a given target to ensure that sufficiently deep transits will be observed.
Table \ref{tab:probabilities} shows if 3 transits are observed for each system, there is more than a 98\% chance of observing a transit with a depth at least 0.3\%, which can place strong constraints on the size of particles escaping K2-22b and KIC 12557548b.\newline

\noindent {\bf Coordinated Simultaneous Observations}\\
It is essential to make simultaneous observations with Spitzer at shorter wavelengths in order to measure the transmission spectral energy distribution of the dust grains escaping K2-22b and KIC 1255b.
The spectral slope of the grain cross section reveals the particle size, shown in Figure \ref{fig:SizeConstraints}.
We therefore include only times that can be observed simultaneously with ground-based photometry.
Our team has extensive experience with ground-based observatories through Carnegie observatories, CFHT and the University of Arizona as well as a strong track record of obtaining time on telescopes for time series observations.\newline

\noindent {\bf Main Objective}\\
Aside from a few limits from ground-based observations, the particle size distribution of these disintegrating bodies is largely unknown.
Our main objective is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SizeConstraints}, where we plot the infrared to optical opacity ratio and how it constrains particle size.
\textbf{We will measure the transit depths in both the optical (using ground based data) and with Spitzer in the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m band.
The ratio of these two bands measures the particle sizes of escaping planet debris up to $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m.}
The particle sizes can be used to constrain the mass loss rate of the system and help distinguish among mass loss mechanisms.

%We have a Cycle 24 HST proposal submitted to observe the same targets with a near-infrared grism.


%The panels have broad scientific expertise.  Include background 
%on the subject you are studying, in particular to help investigators 
%not in your sub-field understand the importance of the research. \newline

%\noindent {\bf General Advice}\\
%If you would like a step-by-step walkthrough of how to submit a
%proposal using Spot, and hints and tips for doing so, please see
%the Observation Planning Cookbook, available on the SSC website.\newline
%
%Please read the Call for Proposals (CP). It is
%the definitive document that describes the requirements
%necessary for your proposal. \newline 
%
%You must submit a PDF version of your proposal. \newline
%
%\noindent {\bf Note that there is no abstract or title or list of people
%in the Science Plan.}  The abstract and title and PI/Co-Is are part of

\subsection{Technical Justification}

\noindent {\bf Time Critical Requirements}\\
Our observations are \textbf{time critical} and must occur during transit so we refer to the ephemerides in Observation Summary.
Furthermore, there have been quiescent periods observed for KIC 1255b of about ~30 days in duration \citep{vanWerkhoven2014}.
We request that the transit observations are separated by 30 days to ensure that they do not fall within quiescent period where all transit depths may be shallow ($\lesssim 0.2\%$ depth).
\newline

\noindent {\bf Signal To Noise}\\
Both planet systems would benefit from the long ``lever arm'' of 4.5$\mu$m photometric measurements. However, signal-to-noise considerations limit the KIC 1255 observations to the 3.6 $\mu$m band.
For consistency and because there is already evidence for wavelength dependence for K2-22b at short wavelengths, we will observe both systems in the 3.6 $\mu$m band.
We used \texttt{pysynphot} with Phoenix stellar models and Simbad $K$ magnitudes to calculate a 3.6 $\mu$m IRAC flux of 1.4 mJy for KIC 1255 and 5.2 mJy for K2-22.
We plugged these values into the time series calculator, \texttt{snirac\_warm}.
For the background fluxes, we use average values provided by Spot of 0.2 MJy/sr for K2-22 and 0.06 MJy/sr for the 3.6$\mu$m band for KIC 1255.
In an optimistic case, we can obtain a SNR of 14,000 in 20 minutes of integration for K2-22 and 5,500 for 20 minutes of integration for KIC 1255.
Even when scaling down the SNR by a factor of 2 discussed in the \texttt{snirac\_warm} documentation, small transit events (0.2\% deep) are detectable at a 5.5 $\sigma$ level for KIC 1255b and 14 $\sigma$ for K2-22b.

The targets in this program are bright enough that confusion limits are not going to present an issue and any astrophysical background will be subtracted out with the aperture photometry and time series baseline. K2-22 has nearby companion star at 1.9'' that will blend the source star, but this can be accounted for using the photometry from Adaptive Optics measurements \citep{sanchis-ojedak2-22}.\newline

%This section contains the technical details for your program. 
%The Technical Justification should contain details of your planned observations, 
%descriptions of scheduling constraints, data analysis plans and a 
%description of how the technical details were validated. For proposals that 
%include generic targets or targets of opportunity, this section should also 
%include a discussion of the provenance and availability of the 
%proposed targets.\newline
%
%Note that you do NOT need to cut-and-paste the AORs into your
%proposal; you submit your proposal using Spot, and the AORs in
%the AOR window when you submit are the ones attached to your
%proposal.  If you accidentally submit the wrong ones, don't worry;
%you can update your proposal as often as you want before
%the deadline.\newline
%
%Make your plans clear by summarizing information in tables
%and using the Observation Summary Table (section 3) to your advantage.\newline
%
%Include brightness estimates 
%for your targets; for example, see the Observation Summary Table
%in section 3.  Based on those brightness estimates, include
%your estimate and justification of what kind of S/N values you
%need to accomplish your science.  Finally, include your
%assessment of background levels (based on Spot, ISSA plates,
%etc.) and explain (if necessary) how you can see your targets
%despite the background. You should include numbers from the 
%online SENS-PET (using the appropriate background setting) 
%that justify going as deeply (or as shallowly) as you have.\newline

%You should explain why you don't need to worry
%about confusion limits or saturation limits, as appropriate, or
%(alternatively) why you think you can get around these limits.\newline
\noindent {\bf Observing and Reduction Strategy}\\
We have followed the Time Series strategies suggested on the Spitzer website.
These include PCRS peakups to place the source on a detector ``sweet-spot'' that has been well characterized and calibrated.
We have included 30 minutes of dithered observations preceding the time series to help stabilize and settle the telescope prior to collecting science data.
For the science frames, we are using repeats rather than dithers because we are doing time series
monitoring and wish to place our object on the same part of the
array.

%Justify any use of low-impact Target of Opportunity observations. \newline
%
%If you have many targets, you may wish to include a separate 
%table rather than a text summary here. Organize the
%table in whatever way makes the most sense to you.   
%Please note: this table is NOT the Observation
%Summary Table described in the CP and below.  \newline
%
%You can also put information about backgrounds or expected target 
%fluxes (or both) into the Observation Summary Table (section
%3), because the Observation Summary Table does not have page
%limits.  \newline
%
%Be sure to include here a detailed assessment of duplications and 
%constraints, just {\em summaries} of which are placed in
%sections 5 and 6.\newline
Our observing team has extensive experience with high precision ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. 
We will process time series data with these existing pipelines as well as consult with other exoplanet scientists who have analyzed secondary eclipses, transits and phase curves with the IRAC warm mission.
The many systematics present in Spitzer light curves should significantly impact our science case since the debris escaping these disintegrating planets has a much larger surface area than the atmospheres of planets typically probed with transit observations.
%
%Finally, have a detailed description of how you will handle the
%data you get, and who will do what from the list of Co-Is.  You
%might want a description of who will lead the entire effort, and
%any additional management discussion for large collaborations.

The cross section ratio curves have been convolved with an assumed log-normal particle size distribution with a width of 2. 
We will measure this ratio with Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m and simultaneous ground-based photometry.
We know from prior ground-based measurements that small particles (i.e., $\lesssim 0.1 \, \mu$m) are ruled out.  
For larger particles, the plot shows how, with increasing median particle size, the transit depth ratio (Spitzer/optical) should go from essentially zero for median particle sizes of $0.3 \, \mu$m to a factor of 1.3 less than optical at $1 \, \mu$m (marked with a vertical blue line), to essentially equal transit depths by $2 \, \mu$m. 
This combination of infrared/optical photometry will, for the first time, allow us to determine the median particle sizes of dusty debris of disintegrating planets up to particle sizes of $\sim$$1.5-2 \,\mu$m.}\label{fig:SizeConstraints}

\section{Summary of Duplicate Observations}

%This section has no page limit. {\it Briefly} summarize the justification for 
%any proposed duplicate observation. The details should have been provided in the
%Science Plan.  Even if there are no duplicates, note this. Leopard should be 
%used to find any duplications, including observations that used Instrument
%Engineering Requests (IERs), since such observations will not
%show up in Spot searches. More information can be found in the
%Leopard User's Guide.\newline

There are two programs that include imaging of the targets in this proposal -- Program 10067 (PI M. Werner) and Program 11026 (PI M. Werner).
Neither of these previous programs is a transit/time series observation that can be used to extract information about the planet or their debris when going in front of the host stars, as discussed in the Science Plan.
Therefore, this program is not a duplicate observation.

%\noindent Example: 
%
%A search using Leopard of the ROC reveals a handful of apparent
%duplications with pid xxx (AOR label ``IRAC-0000''), yyy (all
%AORs), and zzz (AOR label ``IRAC-1234'').  We believe none of
%these are true duplications; see Science Plan for further discussion.  \newline
%
%\noindent or: \newline
%
%\noindent There are no duplicate observations.


\section{Summary of Scheduling Constraints/ToOs}

%This section has no page limit. Briefly summarize the justification for 
%any proposed scheduling constraints. 
%Also provide a summary of any ToO scheduling issues. 
%The details should have been provided in the Science Plan. Even if there 
%are no constraints or ToOs, note this.\newline

These observations are \textbf{time critical} and need to take place when K2-22b and KIC 1255b cross in front of their host stars.
We provide an ephemeris with our time constraints that can be observed with simultaneous ground-based observations.
Furthermore, we request that the observations of each planet system are spaced by at least 20 days to avoid falling into a weaker period observed for KIC 12557548 \citep{vanWerkhoven2014}.

%\noindent Example:
%
%We have placed a loose group-within constraint, spanning 10 days,
%on our three AORs that cover the extended target XXX to 
%minimize field rotation in the large map that will be produced by the AORs.\newline
%
%\noindent or:\noindent 
%
%We will be requesting 1 low-impact ToO and we have indicated this in the 
%AORs.  We anticipate one new comet to be discovered this year that meets 
%our criteria as discussed in the Science Plan.\newline
%
%\noindent or:
%
%There are no scheduling constraints or ToOs in this program.
